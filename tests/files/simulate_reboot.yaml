# create /dev/loopX device nodes before they are needed.
#
# Normally, new nodes are created dynamically by the kernel. But nodes
# in a KinD cluster are started with a copy of /dev from the host and
# loop devices created later on do not show up in that static /dev
# (https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/issues/1248). Creating
# "enough" (100 in this pod) in advance avoids running out of
# loop devices.
